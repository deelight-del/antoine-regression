# Antoine Regression.

Antoine Regression is a Physical Chemistry Concept that utilizes regression methods
to relate the vapour pressure and temperature of pure compounds.

Some constant, A, B, C when evaluated from a series of experimental conditions, can then be used to extrapolate for other experimental conditions that either property is unknown.

A general formula of the Antoine Equation is given as:

 `log(P) = A - B / ( T + C )`

Where P is vapour pressure, T is the temperature, and A, B, and C are Antoine constants.

In order to convert this to a regression equation i.e `y = b + a0x0 + a1x1 + ... anxn`, we will have to rework the equation. See this [link](https://cheguide.com/antoine_eqn.html)
